# Storytime

## Motivation

Story time is a platform for writers who want to foster their confidence and skills in writing, by sharing their works with a community passionate about story telling.

As a visitor of our site, we want to provide the best possible user experience for you. That being said, there are a couple of rules to abide by when engaging with the community.

## Code

### Client

All React components live in the /src/components directory, and their corresponding styles in the src/components/styles. Actions and reducers for redux
are in /src/ as well.

All tests are contained in /__tests__ directories for their corresponding test usage (i.e the /__tests__ folder in /components
contains the tests for the components)

#### Server

Entry point for the application is server.js, and configuration in config.js
/bookshelf contains the PostgreSQL-knex config files
